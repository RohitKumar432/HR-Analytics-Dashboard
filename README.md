# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in Tableau, creating dashboard and tables to analyze the data. The process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualization.

## Data Overview
The dataset contains 1470 records and 39 columns.
Key columns include:

- Attrition: Indicates if an employee has left the company.
- Business Travel: Frequency of business travel.
- Age: Employee age.
- Department: Employeeâ€™s department.
- Gender: Male/Female.
- Monthly Income: Employee monthly salary.
- Job Satisfaction: Employee job satisfaction level.
- Work Life Balance: Employee work-life balance rating.
- Years At Company: Total years at the company.
- Performance Rating: Employee performance score.

## Key Metrics for Dashboard

- Attrition Rate
- Average Monthly Income by Department
- Gender Distribution
- Work-Life Balance Scores
- Years of Service Analysis
- Job Satisfaction vs Attrition
- Performance Rating Distribution

## Suggested Visualizations

- Bar Charts: Attrition by Department, Gender Distribution
- Line Charts: Years at Company vs Attrition
- Pie Charts: Job Role Distribution
- Heatmaps: Work-Life Balance vs Performance
- Scatter Plots: Monthly Income vs Job Satisfaction

## Steps to Build the Dashboard

1. Load the data into Tableau.
2. Clean and preprocess any missing or inconsistent values.
3. Create calculated fields for attrition rate and tenure metrics.
4. Design key visualizations based on business requirements.
5. Add filters for interactive exploration (e.g., by department, age, gender).
6. Finalize dashboard layout and publish the report.
